      "Value at row 19475 of column 'claim_x': 1 . Autonomous sustainable wind unit, reticular multi-blade rotor, accumulator and energy converter and applications which consists of memory, claim and figures and is claimed as “a solidarity set” of an “autonomous energy unit”, operating as a generating source, accumulator, transformer and accumulator and distributor of thermal and dynamic energy, continuously, composed, in the wind field by a wind turbine, with a horizontal axis rotor, consisting of radial reticular trusses, square metal hollow welded and braced bars that support in their extreme sections both self-regulating, simple, double, aerodynamic blades, etc., articulated with a certain eccentricity so that the blades tend to rotate an angle (a), depending on the wind speed, in the direction of the side with the largest surface, at the same time that the deformation reaction of a spring, arranged in each blade, counteracts it until reaching a of equilibrium before the action of the nominal, normal and tangential components of the thrust of the wind, so that the efforts and power of the wind turbine can be determined previously: The wind turbine is endured by a support or cable-stayed tower located on a rotating base platform, which is self-oriented in the convenient direction of the wind by means of a cylindrical pivot in its lower face that rotates inside another cylindrical enclosing tube embedded in the foundation, contains the receiver devices of the transmitted torque, by means of a direct linear transmission belt, from the rotor to the pulleys and shafts of devices and to converters of the kinetic energy into heated water vapor, in a closed circuit with the thermal accumulator of the foundation, serving this at the same time as a fixed foundation on land and as a floating platform in the sea, and in both cases thermal accumulator, fixed or mobile, tank type on land or ship at sea, for distribution, independently and continuously, of thermal energy by means of networks of steam water pipes under pressure, and mechanical energy by transformation of the heat of the use of water with the endothermic turbines, all for supplying global renewable energy in any circumstance and place. The floating base platform can be anchored at any fixed point on the seabed, being self-orientated by the correct direction of the wind thrust, so that with the anchoring elevation can perform navigation, displacement and site maneuvers, and as “tank unit” with thermal load or desalinated water, etc., for its distribution on the coast, according to needs, which may be built entirely in shipyards or at berths, since it can behave like a conventional ship. The support endures the horizontal axis of the windmill composed of a rotor with radial reticular trusses, square metal hollow bars, welded and braced, being able to withstand the efforts, at their ends, of individual self-regulating, simple, double aerodynamic blades, etc. articulated with the aforementioned eccentricity. On one hand the eccentric pressure of the air on the blades is proportional to the square of its speed, (p=0.06 V 2 ), and on the other hand the effective surface of the blades on which it presses, is the normal projection to the direction of the wind, which decreases as a function of the increase of the angle (a) of the blades with the rotor plane and consequently the resulting pressure on the blade decreases, which is inversely proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle (a). The relationship between the cosine of the angle (a) and the speed (V) of the wind is a constant, so that at each speed, corresponds an angle and a certain eccentric action on the blade, which can be stabilized by the corresponding reaction to the deformation of said spring, resulting in each state of equilibrium having an angle (a) and a velocity (V), so that the actions of the wind, (push on the support) and (rotor torque), are equal to the corresponding spring reaction. On the other hand, said actions are controllable by the pressure between the discs of the converters, determining the nominal power and rotation fixed in the project. The speed (V) and angle (a) of balance are equal and superior to the speed the nominal wind speed (V) and angle (a) determined by a rotation stop of the blades. Consequently, for wind speeds lower than the nominal, the angle (a), of incidence of the blade, is fixed by the stop provided, and the powers generated will be those corresponding to the formula W=kR 2 V 3 , less than the nominal, where k it is the coefficient of efficiency that depends on the design of the wind turbine. The generated torque is transmitted, by friction and reaction of a transmission belt, from a perimeter series of knots of trusses, in the same plane, to a series of pulleys, in a line, located at the base platform, which act as axes engines of the various mechanisms of practical application “in situ”, which can be mechanical, electrical, hydraulic and pneumatic among which stand out the multi-disk friction thermal converters, steam generators of heated water, in closed circuit, with the corresponding thermal accumulator, at low environmental pressure and high temperatures, the resulting pressure on the blade decreases, which is inversely proportional to the square of the cosine of the angle (a). The next phase of the extraction of the accumulated thermal energy in mechanics, by means of a closed circuit of water vapor with endothermic turbines, is carried out prior to the increase in the pressure of the water vapor, with the installation and interposition of a “coil” in the interior of the accumulator, and the distribution can take place “in situ” or remotely, in open or closed circuit, by means of networks of steam water pipes under pressure, as a continuous supply, in any circumstance and place, according to demand, whose “solidarity set”, as it is conformed and described, it is characterized because, it complies with the necessary and sufficient characteristics to become a patent object, as an Autonomous Wind Unit, counting to meet this objective, with the necessary and sufficient components, which are detailed then. A) A support, with vertical tubular pillars and inclined braces according to the direction of the wind, which support the thrusts on the plane of rotation of the wind turbine, being installed on a platform of supported rotating base, which if it is on land, by a firm foundation by means of a cylindrical pivot, in another cylinder, with or without a spile, embedded in the foundation, which allows it to rotate and orient itself in a convenient direction of the wind, and if it is on a floating platform with a single anchorage on the seabed, as a conventional vessel, also allows it to self-orientate in the convenient direction of the wind, giving rise, in both cases, to the option of a low tower turbine, whose rotor is located at a small height, on the ground or surface of the water, with less effort due to the lower tipping moment of the support and easier assembly, handling and maintenance of all the mechanisms, with reduction of the risks and increase of the safety. In short, if the wind unit has lower rotor height and lower wind speed than conventional mills, it is compensated by a slight increase in the rotor radius and a lower overturning moment in the support and foundation. The rest of the efforts, in both cases, are proportional to the required nominal power, which in this case turns out to be the maximum allowed by the control systems provided. B) A wind rotor, constituted by radial reticular trusses of square metal bars welded and braced, with greater load of buckling, in normal planes, supporting the normal and horizontal thrusts, to the plane of the rotor, of the blades located in their extreme sections, so that there are triangular structures in lattice and in bracket, of great edge in its embedment in the axis of the rotor, so that the longer bars work to traction and the smaller ones, by the buckling, to compression, rising a simple and resistant construction, whose perimeter knots, in the same plane, serve as support and drag of the tangential thrust of the wind on the blades located in the end sections of the trusses, constituting a coherent mechanism of transmission of torque energy of the rotor, so that with the interposition of a linear element, type of transmission belt, retransmits the power captured, replacing, with an advantage evident. This is because the relative values of the diameters of the rotor and the pulleys are so high and variable that any speed of rotation can be obtained directly in the application mechanisms freely arranged on the base platform, such as converters compressors hydraulic pumps, electric generators etc. C) A few blades consisting of aerodynamic plates of light and resistant material, configured in trapezoidal sectors articulated in the ending sections of the trusses with off-center axes so that the wind thrust on each side of the axis is different tending to turn into the direction of the greater one, so that, with the interposition of a conventional spring, the angle of the blade is controlled, reaching a state of equilibrium, given that a greater thrust of the wind (0.06V 2 ) greater angle but less affected surface, and thrusts normal and tangential controlled by the reaction of the calibrated spring, until the nominal magnitudes of the power of the wind turbine and of the normal and tangential thrusts are fixed and kept fixed on the rotor plane, independently of the wind speed and the angle of the blades, so that the torque and rotation of the rotor is controlled and fixed with the pressure on the discs of the converter, as a “braking”. This characteristic, and other extra-wind circumstances, mean that the maximum efforts of rotation and thrust on all the components of the wind unit, are nominal, of moderate pre-fixed magnitudes, independent of extreme winds. The mechanical efforts of all the components will have values corresponding to the derivatives of values obtained by aerodynamic and mechanical calculations, not claimed, corresponding to the fixed as nominal and maximum wind speed. D) A linear transmission, previously mentioned, of the rotor motor torque, consisting of linear flexible and resistant elements supported and dragged by a flat series of perimeter bars of the rotor, constituting a transmission belt of the tangential thrust of the wind, on the pairs of blades of the end sections of the trusses, constituting a transmitter of the rotation of the rotor in another faster, depending on the relationship between the diameter of the perimeter drag of the rotor and that of the pulleys of the pulleys of the receiving devices, depending on the relationship between the rotor's perimeter drag diameter and that of the pulleys of the receiving devices arranged on the base platform, with a tensor to control the minimum tension of drag adhesion at the perimeter points of the rotor and that of the pulleys, using for this purpose flexible and resistant material, Kevlar or similar, slings of cranes, etc., and even metal chains, depending on the power of the Unit. E) A base platform that constitutes the support of the tower or support and the location of the mechanical devices that receive the energy of the wind rotor, the auxiliary and control means, and that is supported, articulated and oriented in the direction of the wind by means of a cylindrical pivot in the lower base, which rotates inside another cylinder, embedded in the ground foundation or directly on the deck of the floating platform in the sea, which, on the ground, allow the orientation of the wind rotor in the convenient sense with respect to the direction of the wind and in the sea, the orientation is the anchorage of the bottom, like an anchored ship. F) A fixed foundation on the ground and a floating platform at sea, as a support for all possible installations and multiple common functions, as a foundation for its great mass and size, and the enclosure as an accumulator, preferably made of ceramic material, for its lower density and built as tugboat or ship, in any port or berth, and make trips and sites, as autonomous wind unit, complementary services such as storage tank and distributor, base of operations for desalination of seawater, installation of maritime services required, etc., and in both cases, land and sea, the alternative of low turbine with the rotor located at the height closest to the base is adopted, with less overturning moment of the tower and greater ease of assembly, handling and maintenance. These same considerations are applicable to an ideal assembly for a seawater desalination project, with the launching of “reverse osmosis” membrane units, simply joined by the central desalinated water collection conduit provided that the pressure difference between the marine exterior and the interior of the duct is of the order of 80 atmospheres, whose desalinated water can be pumped to the marine surface by the reverse circulation mode with the injection of own water vapor generated and the distribution on the coast by tanker ships, or mono-coque ships. G) Converters, as receiving devices for energy conversion of the torque generated by the wind rotor for direct use according to wind intermittence or for thermal storage, by means of an agitator or multiple friction plate for converting the kinetic energy of the receiver into heat by means of the friction, by controlled contact and pressure, of two series of alternate discs, some fixed to the outer drum or chamber and others to the internal rotation axis so while using it as a converter element the water vapor, flowing through the free surfaces between each pair of discs, it captures the heat of dynamic friction and transmits it directly, in closed circuit, to the thermal accumulator. The absorption of power by friction depends directly on the pressure between pairs of disks, constituting a point of Self-Control of the Unit. It is a kind of braking equal to the power generated by the blades. There are two variables, the speed of rotation and the pressure between discs so that the product, equal to the power, is determined by simple mathematical calculations. And finally, electric generators can be coupled to become a discontinuous conventional wind turbine, which could be modified and improve the thermal accumulator performance, but losing the autonomous character, except with an accumulator complement, keeping the rest of advantages. H) A thermal accumulator, constituted by a closed enclosure, with its corresponding exterior insulation, so that in its interior there are abundant thermal materials and high specific heat, such as ceramic material, with technical characteristics such as specific heat, support of high temperatures, a texture of low density and high permeability, which facilitates a function as a fixed foundation on land and another as nautical floating configuration in the sea, with which you can use water vapor at high temperatures for both accumulation as for the extraction, according to endothermic turbines of water vapor, previous installation of coil to have the necessary high pressures, at the same time that by flotation it serves for all maritime use, of location, transport and mobility like a conventional vessel that can be used for multiple travel autonomy services with energy from the own Unit, such as thermal tanks used to supply thermal energy captured to the coast and desalinated water if practically desalting depth, being especially useful in series of islets, desert coasts, even inaccessible areas, and of course large networks of interior distribution with steam water pipes to pressure, as a supply of running water, heating and environmental conditioning, domestic, industrial, refrigerators, freezers, greenhouse and agricultural and livestock work, and any public or private service. I) An endothermic steam turbine at low pressures and high temperatures, with two elements of radial section in spiral with common axis and inverse directions, and in such arrangement that, first, in the same direction of rotation of axis one works with contraction and another one in expansion, that is, the two necessary functions so in fast rotations, the water vapor, heated in circulation, in closed circuit, through the accumulator, at environmental pressure, contracts in the first of them, conserving the temperature and pressure, and when passing, the common inner tubular shaft through the second expansion loses temperature and pressure whose energies are transformed into an increase in tangential pressure on the walls of the turbine or mechanical work, and this in torque that acts on the common axis, so that the difference, between the motor pairs of the two basic elements of turbine, is the energy efficiency of the process, and in secondly, if a pressure coil is placed inside the accumulator, the water vapor can be extracted at high pressures and temperatures and, reducing the size of the endothermic turbine and the installations, as an alternative to compact turbines of greater power and smaller size, when treating high density water vapor that simplifies the process and increases the efficiency and performance, being especially useful in the improvement and replacement of conventional steam turbines and in new installations. With a similar process, it is applicable to aeronautics in the modality of turboprop activated with this alternative of endothermic turbine and thermal energy source of a compact accumulator or conventional combustion, being the nuclear the preferred and efficient especially in large aircraft, for performance and autonomy. J) An endothermic turbine of high pressures and temperatures, in closed circuit, with a source of heat of any origin while wind is a fundamental element and integral part of an energy unit, it is also possible to refer to other sources of energy, such as fossil combustible thermal, nuclear fission, etc In cases of emergency, repair or replacement in large power facilities such as offshore wind farms, it is convenient and sometimes necessary to resort to a faster and more compact complementary energy source such as that of nuclear origin. The process is the same with the facility that the reactor is integrated into a simplified compact enclosure. The tubes of the structure, serve as capsules of simple combustible rods, of pellets of minimal reactivity, so that if they are very short and alternate with inner bars of equally short neutral elements, with a simple vertical translation of centimeters, of an active set in relation to the other activates or extinguishes the whole system. It is a segmented or fractionated combustible rod, so that with the transfer of the length of a pellet the transfer of all the components of a bar is carried out, or of each and every one, what supposes the almost total reduction of the casing outside of the own reactor. With simple high pressure (125 k/cm 2 ) and high temperature (425° C.) chambers, modules of several MW and even higher can be obtained, to the extent that with a specific treatment they would replace the complex of the current reactors and in project, for these low reactivity fed exclusively by those considered today as radioactive waste, very problematic. All this would be more economical than its confinement and control. The contribution of waste properly handled in small proportions is very profitable since the normal performance of a conventional plant is not higher than 85%. From this it can be deduced that with the endothermic turbines proposed with low reactivity material, the cost of fuel is a small percentage of the project budget. This mode allows the construction of very compact endothermic turbines so that they can be applied to all types of equipment, fixed or mobile, terrestrial or marine, underground or submarine, nautical or aeronautical, etc. You just have to apply the proposed global application mechanisms. These sets of minimum size can replace and renew, in short term, the current mobile parks of all kinds both, terrestrial, nautical and aeronautical, including submarines, of an unpredictable future. And in aeronautics, using water vapor, at high pressure and temperature, as a driving gas, as a “jet”, can compete with conventional reactors. K) An environmental endothermic turbine is an alternative modality to the one derived from the priority objective of this patent application, which is the use of autonomous wind energy, however, another objective is the provision of autonomous energy in any circumstance and place, and other sources of emergency, repairs or substitution have been mentioned, because it is a chain process of interdependent natural links, each and every one of them being necessary and sufficient to make up the so-called global autonomous unit. Another issue is the autonomic demand for service guarantee, or the characteristics of the place, which lead to exceptional situations of emergency, maintenance or replacement, being mandatory to resort to other energy sources or modalities due to the type of energy required, such as static, dynamic, mechanical or chemical transformer, underground or submerged, desalination, obtaining hydrogen fuel by hydrolysis, etc., in which case, alternatives for these exceptional cases are included. From the point of view of autonomy, it has been assumed that any point can be supplied, including those lacking minimum wind, with a global distribution network, but this alternative will have its limits for several reasons such as inaccessibility, distance, etc. in which case it is obligatory to resort to sustainable emergency types with more or less simplicity and performance, as is described in the previous section “J”. Another alternative is the particular case of an endothermic turbine that consists simply of two inverse spirals, with internal communication through the common axis and tractor, whose idea is that water vapor from the hot environment is contracted by rotation in the first spiral, with small absorption of energy by contraction of water vapor and at the same time by heating the air, by increasing pressure, so that passing to the common chamber of the shaft accesses the second spiral in expansion with loss of heat and pressure of the water vapor with the outlet to the environment, just so in this expansion the energy of the air pressure of the first one is recovered and of the transformation of the temperature lost by the content of water vapor, at whose environmental temperature it must be added the one transferred by the increase of temperature through the air due to its compression in the common chamber of the shaft, so that the difference of positive energies, once the negatives absorbed by the first contraction have been deducted, have been transformed into mechanical work, in the form of torque from the common tractor axle, which defines the performance of the so called environmental endothermic turbine, having, among others, an application practice in which, in addition to the environmental cooling of a hot space, a certain mechanical energy can be obtained, adaptable to any circumstance. L) And finally the endothermic turbine has a double function of transforming the thermal energy of water vapor at low and high pressures, predominating the second in the wind and alternative emergency areas, such as nuclear for all types of spaces and fixed appliances and mobile phones, and the first ones in open spaces, such as the environmental endothermic turbine, the turbo-jet for water steam and the assistance of internal combustion turbine\n"

      "Window 1: CROSS-REFERENCE TO A RELATED APPLICATION The invention described and claimed hereinbelow is also described in German Patent Application DE 10 2006 012 008.6 filed on Mar. 14, 2006. This German Patent Application, whose subject matter is incorporated here by reference, provides the basis for a claim of priority of invention under 35 U.S.C. 119(a)-(d). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an electrohydraulic control unit for rotor blade adjustment of a wind farm. One such electrohydraulic control unit is known from German Utility Model DE 203 17 749. In wind farms, rotor blades are adjustable about a rotor blade axis within a predetermined angle range, so that the rotor blade can be positioned into the wind (known as “pitching out”) or positioned relative to the wind direction (known as “pitching in”). Since rotor blades are very expensive and vulnerable, and because of the strong forces that prevail especially in a strong wind, a rotor blade adjustment must be made sensitively and without abrupt deceleration or acceleration.

One such electrohydraulic control unit is known from German Utility Model DE 203 17 749. In wind farms, rotor blades are adjustable about a rotor blade axis within a predetermined angle range, so that the rotor blade can be positioned into the wind (known as “pitching out”) or positioned relative to the wind direction (known as “pitching in”). Since rotor blades are very expensive and vulnerable, and because of the strong forces that prevail especially in a strong wind, a rotor blade adjustment must be made sensitively and without abrupt deceleration or acceleration. The rotor blade adjustment is done hydraulically via a hydraulic cylinder, with one piston chamber and one piston rod chamber. A pressure line is in constant pressure fluid connection with the piston rod chamber. The piston rod chamber communicates with the piston chamber via a proportional seat valve. The piston chamber can be relieved to a tank via a further proportional seat valve. In this embodiment, if the high degree of fail-safety is to be attained, the additional valves required entail major effort and expense for equipment, and hence complex engineering and high costs.

The electrohydraulic control unit of the invention serves to adjust the rotor blades of a wind farm via a hydraulic cylinder. The hydraulic cylinder has one piston chamber and one piston rod chamber. Via an inflow valve assembly, a pressure fluid connection can be established between the pump and the piston chamber, while via an outflow valve assembly, a pressure fluid connection can be established between the piston rod chamber and the tank. Each valve assembly has at least two parallel-connected switch valves with a different maximum flow volume, which are switchable in various combinations in the form of digital hydraulics in order to establish different volumetric flows and to establish a desired position of the hydraulic cylinder and thus the pitch angle.
